If you proceed to a trial with this family, please advise the NQN team via email or direct message with the date, time, and family name/job number of the family you are meeting. It is very important that you let us know so we can follow up after your trial.

Following your trial, please provide us with written feedback, including the family name/job number and whether you would like to move forward with the family or not. If it is the latter, you will be expected to call the family directly to update them on your decision. The NQN team is unable to do this for you.

If you are struggling to get hold of the family after 48 hours, please get in touch with the NQN team.

If you have any questions in the meantime, please do not hesitate to ask. 

Kind regards,
